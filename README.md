Purpose: Weather website aimed at helping individuals with cognitive disorders (eg. dementia or ADHD). These individuals may struggle  to process and remember the necessary information to choose appropriate clothing based on weather conditions. The app simplifies the decision-making process by providing direct suggestions, reducing the mental effort required to assess temperature, preference, and other weather factors. For individuals who might rely on caregivers or family members for guidance, a weather app allows them to make clothing choices independently. This helps maintain autonomy and boosts confidence in daily activities.
